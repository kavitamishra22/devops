 
# Challenge #2
# We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS or Azure or GCP
# and provide a json formatted output.
#The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

# Ans.-> To query the metadata of an instance within AWS, Azure, or GCP using a bash script, you can utilize curl. Here are bash scripts for each of the three mentioned cloud providers:
# AWS provides a metadata service for EC2 instances that can be queried from within the instance.

#!/bin/bash

get_aws_metadata() {
    base_url="http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"
    # Example: Fetch instance ID and type. You can fetch other metadata similarly.
    paths=("instance-id" "instance-type")
    
    echo "{"
    for path in "${paths[@]}"; do
        value=$(curl -s "${base_url}${path}")
        echo "\"${path}\": \"${value}\","
    done
    echo "}"
}
